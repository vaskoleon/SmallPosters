# SmallPosters
Ad Registration API Service with example Single Page Application front-end

## What is SmallPosters?
SmallPosters is an API Service built in ASP.NET Core, with an example Single Page Application front-end, which is built using Sammy.js and JQuery.

## What does SmallPosters offer?
It offers users the capability to publish ads for anything which they might choose.

## How does SmallPosters work?
SmallPosters includes in its API the option to register and log in, using an AuthToken system. Logged in users can create new ads, which are registered into the system. Users also have the option of editing and deleting their ads. However, before newly created ads can be seen by other users, they must first be approved by the Administrator - a user with special privileges, who sees newly created ads in real time, and has the option to either approve or reject them. 

All of the different parts of the application can be tested out through its Single Page Application front-end.
